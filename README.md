The **Cosmic Emanator** is a speculative, research-grade framework for artificial intelligence based on  
**sacred geometry**, **cosmic topology**, and **harmonic physics**. Built in PyTorch, it introduces a fractal approach to AI computation inspired by:

- 🌀 Recursive spirals and toroidal dynamics
- 🧬 Emanation theory and topological symmetry
- 🔺 Platonic solids and the golden ratio
- 🌐 Quantum simulations of geometry and entanglement

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/Cosmic-Emanator_V2.git
cd Cosmic-Emanator_V2
pip install -r requirements.txt
All simulations and layers can be run directly via the Jupyter notebooks in /notebooks.

🌐 What Is It?
The Cosmic Emanator proposes a topological AI framework rooted in sacred geometry and recursive emanation. It reimagines neural networks as:

Fractal unfoldings (inspired by the Flower and Fruit of Life)

Toroidal recirculation layers (energy never lost)

Recursive modulations based on φ (golden ratio)

Infinite spiral growth to avoid feedback traps

This geometric metaphysics informs a software-first neural processor stack extensible to futuristic hardware like:

⊚ Twisted bilayer graphene AI cores

⊚ Toroidal photonic lattices

⊚ Zero-point energy feedback designs
