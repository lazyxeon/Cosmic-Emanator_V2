# Cosmic Emanator: A Geometric Framework for Emanative Reality

The Cosmic Emanator is a speculative, interdisciplinary model that conceptualizes the universe as a dynamic, self-regulating system of emanation. Rooted in the Flower of Life's overlapping circles, it extends into a non-orientable twisted toroidal manifold, layered with elements that facilitate growth, polarity, activation, structure, duality, emanation, eternity, resonance, and harmony.

# Cosmic Emanator: A Geometric Framework for Emanative Reality

The **Cosmic Emanator** is a speculative, interdisciplinary model blending physics, metaphysics, and machine learning to emulate the recursive architecture of the cosmos. It proposes a new kind of AI layerâ€”the **Topological-Fractal Neural Processor (TFNP)**â€”based on toroidal geometry, spiral growth, and harmonic activation.

This repo includes:
- A PyTorch implementation of the TFNP layer
- Jupyter notebooks simulating entropy and noise tolerance
- Mathematical derivations and symbolic models
- A mini whitepaper explaining the theory and applications

## ðŸŒŒ Model Description

The model views reality as an emanative process. It starts from a central void (**bindu**) and unfolds through layered geometries like toroids, spirals, triangles, and spheres.

- **Geometry**: A twisted torus with embedded Fibonacci spirals, duality gates, and fractal structures
- **Activation**: Sinusoidal functions inspired by Tesla and Merkaba fields
- **Mathematics**: Custom Lagrangian combining curvature, torsion, potential, and oscillator terms
- **Use Cases**: AI robustness, physics simulation, cosmological analogs, energy systems

## ðŸ§  TFNP PyTorch Layer

Implements:
- **Toroidal twist modulation**
- **Fibonacci scaling**
- **Merkaba activation**

```python
from src.tfnp_layer import TFNPLayer
model = TFNPLayer(in_channels=3, out_channels=64)
input = torch.rand(1, 3, 32, 32)
output = model(input, t=1.0)
print(output.shape)  # [1, 64, 32, 32]
