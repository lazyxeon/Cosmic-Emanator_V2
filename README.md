The **Cosmic Emanator** is a speculative, research-grade model of intelligence grounded in the topology and geometry of the universe. Inspired by toroidal flows, Fibonacci spirals, and quantum dualities, it reimagines neural computation as a process of **emanation** — recursive, cyclical, and fractal in essence.

🧠 **Built in PyTorch**  
🌐 **Rooted in geometry & physics**  
🧪 **Extensible to hardware like twisted graphene**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📥 Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/Cosmic-Emanator.git
cd Cosmic-Emanator
pip install -r requirements.txt

🧬 What Is It?
The TFNP (Topological-Fractal Neural Processor) is a novel neural network layer that combines:

🔄 Toroidal topology – Twisted manifold for cyclical data flow

🌀 Fibonacci scaling – Spiral-based expansion: r(ψ) = a·e^{b·ψ}

⚛️ Merkaba/Tesla activation – Time-varying sinusoidal dynamics

🌐 Non-local tensor modulation – Inspired by cosmic twist/shear fields

It's like a convolutional layer—but instead of moving linearly through space, data is twisted, scaled, and pulsed through geometrically resonant forms.

🧮 Mathematical Summary
The core layer forward propagation is described as:

r
Yₗ = sin(2π·f·t) · (Wₗ · (Xₗ₋₁ ⊗ T) + bₗ)
Where:

T = exp(i·α·(ϕᵢ - ϕⱼ)) → Twist tensor with phase shift

α = 7/2 → Asymmetry constant

ϕ ≈ 1.618 → Golden ratio (phi) scaling

t → Time/frequency input
