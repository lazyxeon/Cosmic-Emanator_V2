# 🌌 Cosmic Emanator: A Geometric Framework for Emanative AI

**“Software-first, hardware-ready – AI that thinks like the universe.”**

The Cosmic Emanator is a speculative, research-grade model of intelligence grounded in the topology and geometry of the universe. Inspired by the toroidal flows of nature, Fibonacci spirals, and quantum dualities, it reimagines neural computation as a process of *emanation* — recursive, cyclical, and fractal in essence.

> 🌐 Rooted in geometry & physics  
> 🧪 Extensible to hardware like twisted graphene

Edit
from src.tfnp_layer import TFNPLayer
import torch

model = TFNPLayer(3, 64)  # RGB input, 64 output channels
input_tensor = torch.rand(1, 3, 32, 32)
output = model(input_tensor, t=1.0)
print(output.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 64, 32, 32])
🧬 What Is It?
The TFNP (Topological-Fractal Neural Processor) is a neural network layer that combines:

Toroidal topology: A twisted manifold for cyclical data flow

Fibonacci scaling: Spiral-based expansion r(ψ) = a·e^{b·ψ}

Merkaba/Tesla activation: Time-varying sinusoidal dynamics

Non-local tensor modulation: Inspired by cosmic twist/shear fields

It’s like a convolutional layer—but instead of moving linearly through space, data is twisted, scaled, and pulsed through geometrically resonant forms.

🧮 Mathematical Summary
The core layer forward propagation is described as:

Yₗ = sin(2π·f·t) · (Wₗ · (Xₗ₋₁ ⊗ T) + bₗ)
Where:
- `T = exp(i·α·(ϕᵢ - ϕⱼ))` → Twist tensor with phase shift
- `α = 7/2` → Asymmetry constant
- `ϕ ≈ 1.618` → Golden ratio (phi) scaling
- `t` → Time/frequency input
