## 1. Vesica Piscis: Core Intersection Motif

**🔹 Role:**  
The Vesica Piscis is the lens-shaped overlap of two circles, symbolizing "portals" or duality resolution in the Flower of Life (FoL). It's the foundational building block, with intersections generating further circles.

**🔣 Formula:**  
Height to Width Ratio = √3 : 1

**🧮 Derivation:**
- Place centers at (0, 0) and (r, 0)
- Circle equations:  
  `x² + y² = r²`  
  `(x - r)² + y² = r²`
- Subtract to find: `x = r/2`
- Plug in: `y² = (3/4)r²` → `y = ± (r√3)/2`
- Full height = `r√3`

**✅ Cross-Check:**  
Forms equilateral triangle → confirms √3 ratio across the Vesica.

## 2. Seed of Life: 7-Circle Foundation

**🔹 Role:**  
Expands Vesica into a symmetric hexagonal lattice. Used as the base topology for toroidal flow in the Emanator.

**🧮 Formulas:**
- Central circle at (0, 0)
- Six outer circles at:  
  `(r cos(k·π/3), r sin(k·π/3))` for `k = 0` to `5`

**✅ Verification:**
- Each peripheral circle is distance `r` from center
- Each neighboring center is distance `r` apart
- Confirms **D₆ symmetry** and perfect hexagonal tiling

## 3. Platonic Solids: Anchors in the 3D Emanator

Extracted from Metatron's Cube, these represent symmetry and structure at higher spatial layers.

| Octahedron        | (a³√2) / 3                    | ≈ 0.471           |
| Dodecahedron      | a³·(15 + 7√5)/4               | ≈ 7.663           |
| Icosahedron       | 5a³(3 + √5)/12                | ≈ 2.182           |

## 5. Fibonacci Spiral: Growth Curve

**🔹 Formula (approx.):**  
```
r(θ) = a · φ^θ      or      r(θ) = a · e^(kθ)
```
Where:
- φ ≈ 1.618 (Golden Ratio)
- `k = ln(φ) / (π/2) ≈ 0.306`

**🧮 Derivation:**

**✅ Cross-Check:**
- Matches polar spiral growth
- Appears in sunflower, nautilus, and galactic structures — verified symmetry with φ recurrence
