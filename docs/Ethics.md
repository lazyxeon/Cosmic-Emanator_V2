# Ethics Guidelines for the Cosmic Emanator

## Principles
- **Unity in Diversity**: Promote inclusive apps; test on diverse datasets to mitigate bias (e.g., sim 9 shows stable acc).
- **Anti-Trap**: Favor infinite Kryst variants (sim 8) to avoid confining cycles in AI (e.g., echo chambers).
- **Dual-Use Caution**: Geometry could be weaponized (e.g., psy-ops via patterns); restrict sensitive sims (foam/entanglement).
- **Transparency**: Open-source all; cite sources (e.g., Melchizedek for activations).
- **Ascension Focus**: Use for positive (e.g., consciousness sims via biophotons); audit for illusion risks (Gnostic critiques).
- **Guardianship**: Inspired by ancientsâ€”contribute responsibly; report misuse.

## Best Practices
- Diverse Training: Balance unified/fragmented data.
- Bias Audits: Monitor var(acc) <0.01.
- Consent: For AI apps, ensure user awareness of geometric influences.
